A. Remaining Issues/To Do
   
   2/19/2017
   --"Checkout" button in cart is not properly aligned.
   --"Past Events" need to be better organized. Hire MTurk workers to
      help categorize text so I can post them as tagged blog posts?
   --"Checkout" page would not let me display full text of pledge to
      sign. Instead, noted pledge in the product description.
   --Tables on "Executive Council" and "Chapter History" not ideally
      displayed on mobile. Plain text does not look good either. May 
      just leave this as is.
   --Tagline on mobile still reading "Just another WordPress site."
      This may be related to Google caching.
   --Gina requested moving DC-AAPOR text in logo to overlap with
      Capitol design. I tried this and it does not look right to me.
      May try other things.
   --High res logo for swag orders
   --Back end: Clean up unused plug-ins.
   
   --Council will test. Temika will usability test.
   --After testing:
     -Move old site to back-up URL (archives.dc-aapor.org?)
     -Migrate URL
     -Set-up PayPal
     -Add Google Analytics after this is complete
     -Check links are correct
     -Make sure SSL is in effect on main URL
     -Check on FTP/ability to file upload
