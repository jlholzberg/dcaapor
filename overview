A. Remaining Issues/To Do
   
   Reviewer comments
   
   -Overall and mobile
   --Speed: slow to load home page and between pages
   --Move social media links to bottom of page/make sure search is emphasized
   --Move hamburger menu to upper right
   --Reduce logo size for mobile
   --Make navigation breadcrumb links blue
   --Make subpages the clickable ones instead of the visible pages? Right now
   navigation is different from mobile/desktop?
   --Fix tables
   --Some weird text overhang with become a member page on mobile
   --Remove bottom navigation links on each page
   --Extend breadcrumbs to all pages
   --Home and About are the same pages-- change this
   --Make highest level active link as opposed to sublink for "home"
   --Don't use "click here" as link text
   
   -Homepage
   --4 pillars under title look clickable but are not
   --Remove emphasis on council and history. Move up events and how to join in
   2nd paragraph
   --The DC chapter, not the local chapter
   --Remove "intellectual" from 2nd sentence. Also long- reword. See below.
   
   DC-AAPOR, the DC local chapter of the American Association for Public Opinion 
   Research (AAPOR), is an active, intellectual community of researchers, 
   academics, and other professionals engaged in the methods, applications, 
   and findings of public opinion research and survey methodology.  
   DC-AAPOR provides an exciting forum for discussion and debate about 
   methodological, ethical, and substantive issues related to a range of 
   research topics.
   
   -Council
   --Make my email addresses consistent
   --History versus current gives different years (16-17 v. 17)
   
   -Bylaws
   --Make "council" plural
   
   -Membership
   --Change last sentence:  “Alternatively, you can join DC-AAPOR anytime from our 
   website.”  Make “Join DC-AAPOR” the link. Alternatively, you could have a big, 
   red “Join Now!” button, which people should see easily (and be really tempted to click!).
   --Make generally clearer how to renew through the website
   --Options under joining are surprising-- one membership page with join now button instead
   or two options: "Join or Join/Renew" and "My Account"
   
   -Checkout and store
   --Center 2 memberships on store page
   --“Page Cannot Be Displayed” message (because of Sandbox?)
   --Shopping cart displayed in menu bar is weird- replace with shopping cart
   text. Or make visible only if add to cart?
   --Wouldn't let update cart (because of Sandbox?)- only let do coupon- did
   not see proceed to checkout further down page without scrolling
   --Red X at beginning of row needs to be clearer as to purpose
   --Member billing info did not come up at first
   --Hide default sorting because only two options
   --Put description of items under the two shopping choices. Unclear that need
   to click box to buy
   --Remove "showing all 2 results"
   --Membership added/view cart not clearly visible. Change messaging?
   --Returning customers confusing with no mention of renewing
   
   -Past events
   --Remove first sentence
   
   -Awards and student paper
   --Deadline for submitting?
   
   -Photos
   --Some displaying very small- way to fix?
   --Email address may not be correct
   
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   3/3/2017
   --Add membership list with hidden URL. Needs to be updated quarterly
   --Hidden affinity group page with uploaded PDFs
   --See three series of comments from reviewers
   --Email listserv: use MailChimp or WordPress plug in instead of UMD?
   --Find out who other than Scott and Temika gave comments so I can thank them
   
   2/19/2017
   --"Checkout" button in cart is not properly aligned.
   --"Past Events" need to be better organized. Hire MTurk workers to
      help categorize text so I can post them as tagged blog posts?
   --"Checkout" page would not let me display full text of pledge to
      sign. Instead, noted pledge in the product description.
   --Tables on "Executive Council" and "Chapter History" not ideally
      displayed on mobile. Plain text does not look good either. May 
      just leave this as is.
   --Tagline on mobile still reading "Just another WordPress site."
      This may be related to Google caching.
   --Gina requested moving DC-AAPOR text in logo to overlap with
      Capitol design. I tried this and it does not look right to me.
      May try other things.
   --High res logo for swag orders
   --Back end: Clean up unused plug-ins.
   
   --Council will test. Temika will usability test.
   --After testing:
     -Move old site to back-up URL (archives.dc-aapor.org?)
     -Migrate URL
     -Set-up PayPal
     -Add Google Analytics after this is complete
     -Check links are correct
     -Make sure SSL is in effect on main URL
     -Check on FTP/ability to file upload
