A. Remaining Issues/To Do
*********************************************************************  
   Reviewer comments
   
   -Overall and mobile
   --Speed: slow to load home page and between pages. May be plug-in related
   ---Consider new photo gallery plug-in
   --Update links?
      
   -Checkout and store
   --Options under joining are surprising-- one membership page with join now button instead
   or two options: "Join or Join/Renew" and "My Account"
   --“Page Cannot Be Displayed” message (because of Sandbox?) 
   --Put description of items under the two shopping choices. Unclear that need
   to click box to buy
         
  
   **Issues that I will proceed without resolving**
   -Overall and mobile
   --Update membership quarterly  
   --Weird file name issue with bylaws-- still had it on old site too
   
   -Checkout and store: some of these I either cannot change or did not experience in my own testing/think may be Sandbox related
   --Red X at beginning of row needs to be clearer as to purpose
   --Member billing info did not come up at first
   --Wouldn't let update cart (because of Sandbox?)- only let do coupon- did
   not see proceed to checkout further down page without scrolling
   --Deadlines for awards and student paper nominations?
   --State should be scroll wheel instead of drop down
   
   -Photos
   --Some displaying very small- way to fix? (seems to be thumbnail issue-- lots of duplicate photos too)
   
   -Other
   --Upload membership list on hidden page
   --Contact Patti and Mandy about the affinity page

   B. Notes
  *********************************************************************
   
   6/9/2017
   --Deleted Breadcrumb and Search Everything
   
   -Speed edits
   --Deactivated and removed plug-ins: could possibly do this with more of them
   --Installed cache plug-in but it's not active/might need to use another kind
   --Revisions control to get rid of earlier drafts of pages
   
   3/3/2017
   --See three series of comments from reviewers
   --Email listserv: use MailChimp or WordPress plug in instead of UMD?
   --Find out who other than Scott and Temika gave comments so I can thank 
   them
      
   2/19/2017
   --"Past Events" need to be better organized. Hire MTurk workers to
      help categorize text so I can post them as tagged blog posts?
   --"Checkout" page would not let me display full text of pledge to
      sign. Instead, noted pledge in the product description.
   --Tables on "Executive Council" and "Chapter History" not ideally
      displayed on mobile. Plain text does not look good either. May 
      just leave this as is.
   --Tagline on mobile still reading "Just another WordPress site."
      This may be related to Google caching.
   --Gina requested moving DC-AAPOR text in logo to overlap with
      Capitol design. I tried this and it does not look right to me.
      May try other things.
   --High res logo for swag orders
   --Back end: Clean up unused plug-ins.
   
   --Site launch:
     -Move old site to back-up URL (archives.dc-aapor.org?)
     -Migrate URL
     -Set-up PayPal
     -Add Google Analytics after this is complete
     -Check links are correct
     -Make sure SSL is in effect on main URL
     -Check on FTP/ability to file upload
*********************************************************************
C. Resolved Issues
*********************************************************************
   -Overall and mobile
   --Move social media links to bottom of page/make sure search is emphasized
   --Remove bottom navigation links on each page
   --Don't use "click here" as link text
   --Move hamburger menu to upper right 
   ---Note: in doing this, I had to hide search because could not figure out how to get it to align properly
   --Reduce logo size for mobile: could possibly reduce this more
   --Fix tables
   --Some weird text overhang with become a member page on mobile
   --Make navigation breadcrumb links blue
   --Extend breadcrumbs to all pages
   --Created hidden pages for affinity group and membership list
   --Make subpages the clickable ones instead of the visible pages? Right now navigation is different from mobile/desktop?
   --Home and About are the same pages-- change this
    --Make sure Becca and events are properly updated
    --Update bylaws
   
   -Council
   --Make my email addresses consistent
   --History versus current gives different years (16-17 v. 17)
   --Spacing of past council table weird
   
   -Bylaws
   --Make "council" plural
   
   -Checkout and store
   --Remove "showing all 2 results"
   --Hide default sorting because only two options
   --Returning customers confusing with no mention of renewing
   --Shopping cart displayed in menu bar is weird- replace with shopping cart text. Or make visible only if add to cart?
   --Center 2 memberships on store page
   --Hide coupon?
   --Membership added/view cart not clearly visible. Change messaging?
   --"add to cart" changed to "purchase membership" with direct re-direct
   
   -Membership
   --Change last sentence:  “Alternatively, you can join DC-AAPOR anytime from our 
   website.”  Make “Join DC-AAPOR” the link. Alternatively, you could have a big, 
   red “Join Now!” button, which people should see easily (and be really tempted to click!).
   --Make generally clearer how to renew through the website
   
   -Homepage
   --4 pillars under title look clickable but are not
   --Remove emphasis on council and history. Move up events and how to join in
   2nd paragraph
   --The DC chapter, not the local chapter
   --Remove "intellectual" from 2nd sentence. Also long- reword. See below.
   
   DC-AAPOR, the DC local chapter of the American Association for Public Opinion 
   Research (AAPOR), is an active, intellectual community of researchers, 
   academics, and other professionals engaged in the methods, applications, 
   and findings of public opinion research and survey methodology.  
   DC-AAPOR provides an exciting forum for discussion and debate about 
   methodological, ethical, and substantive issues related to a range of 
   research topics.
      
   -Past events
   --Remove first sentence
   
   -Photos
   --Email address may not be correct
